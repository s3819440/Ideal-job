<h4>Experience: </h4>
<p>Relevant experience in the IT industry is necessary, more specifically in the network security spectrum. The more years experience in the industry the better, has individual will need a sound understanding of IT security issues and trends. I say at least 3 years of relevant experience in IT and security. Also the understanding of security standards is necessary and crucial.</p>

<h4>Current skills, qualifications and experience</h4>
<p>Currently have some general level IT experience working in several organisations and having frequent involvement with the IT side of things.

.</p>

<h4>Detailed plan on attaining this role</h4>
<p>My plan on obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required to become a cyber security analyst is outlined in 6 steps;</p>

<br /> My first step is to of course graduate with my bachelors of IT, this is crucial for my pursuit for this career. Whilst completing my degree I will take on study for the Comptia a+ Certification, this covers general IT information and practices and will further my chances of getting employment after my degree. <br />

<br /> Next I will take on an entry level position in the IT industry preferably in Melbourne CBD. I will try to land this position as early as possible, whilst even completing my studies if I become skilled enough.<br />

<br />Once working in an entry level IT role, I will continue to further my education through acquiring several certifications. Certifications such as; CompTIA Security+,SSCP, CCNA Security or equivalent will be beneficial and increase my chances of landing a cyber security analyst role.<br />

<br />I will always be on the lookout for opportunities to further my knowledge and know how of the IT security field within my own organisation. At this point experience is what would set me apart and likely give me the edge in landing a cyber security analyst role. I will look for junior security roles, find a mentor even, ways of going about this to prepare myself.<br />

<br />Finally after roughly a year or 2 in the industry I will actively start looking for positions within my own organisation as well as seek. Although I may lack the necessary years of experience, I will still boldly pursuit this career until I get it.</p>
